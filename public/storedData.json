The two avenues through which these goal -s will be furthered are education and networking. The former includes the offering of hands-on BI tool use at meetings, on-line review material, and connections with experts. The latter involves inter -actions with club members who share the same interests and opportunities to engage with outside professionals at both IAS and other BI events.
